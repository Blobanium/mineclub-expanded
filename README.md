# Mineclub Expanded

## NOTE

    * This Experimental Branch is only to show a proof-of-concept of sending data to a remote discord server via a webhook.
    * Doing this can make alot of insane things possible: Such as tracking unobtainable rolls, real-time market tracking, etc.
    *
    * Right now, There are many flaws to how it is implemented and is not the final product.
    * If your looking for a stable branch, consider checking the master branch.
